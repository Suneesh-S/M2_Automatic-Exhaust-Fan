# Requirements
## Introduction
 * In high end Modular Kitchen,Electrical Chimney to reduce the heat and smoke coming out of the stove.But its not affordable for the middle class family.They normally use manual switch on Exhaust Fan for there kitchen.
 * Automatic Exhaust Fan can be used to reduce there work and also make their smaller kitchen even smarter.It detect the temperature of the kitchen room and turns on the exhaust fan when temperature exceeds certain limit. 

## Research
### Electrical Calculator...
* This is a simple project which simply provide required electrical parameters value to the user after taking input from the user. 
* This calculator is using various formulas for different functions,research are done in the particular calculation and theres need to be perequites before entering to the program

## Cost and Features
* This project has various features, like it can provide air circulating system inside the Kitchen 
* It can reduce the temperature of the kitchen with automatic approach
* It can sense the high rise of temperature and alarm the family
* The cost of the system is less compares to the Electric Chimney

## Defining Our System
* System bacically takes temperature input from the environment and executes the particular function according to the Temperature and then Display the Temperature.
* There are 3 types of functions in this Calculator
  * Displays the Temperature of the Kitchen
  * Controls the Exhaust Fan according to the Temperature
  * Sounds the alarm during the sense of danger
  

## SWOT ANALYSIS

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

* All the small and medium size kitchen family can use this device.

## What:

* Automatic Exhaust Fan used to turn on the exhaust fan when needed and sound the alaram when danger sense.

## When:

* During the step-In training, this is the final project assessment and development started on 4th April.

## Where:

* This can be used in all medium and small sized Kitchen.

## How:

* users can use this device to ease their work even more comfortable.
